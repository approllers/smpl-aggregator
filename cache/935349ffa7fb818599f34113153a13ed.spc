<p>Case in point: Lego recently refused to ship a bulk order to artist Ai Weiwei citing a longstanding policy of not directly providing pieces to those who seek to make political statements. <a href="https://instagram.com/p/9PJl_XqDyX/">Ai took to Instagram to declare</a>: &ldquo;Lego's refusal to sell its product to the artist is an act of censorship and discrimination." The more charitable interpretation of Lego&rsquo;s actions, <a href="http://jaysbrickblog.com/2015/10/27/my-take-on-legosforweiwei-and-censorship/">most eloquently voiced by Jay Ong</a>, is that Lego wasn&rsquo;t meaningfully restricting Ai&rsquo;s freedom to make art since there are plenty of other places to buy in bulk. No matter how you look at the situation, however, it is clear that Lego at least desired some distance from a political piece of art.</p>

The works were planned for the exhibition "Andy Warhol / Ai Weiwei" at the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, Australia, to open in December 2015. The artworks' concept relates to freedom of speech. The museum's curatorial team contacted Lego to place a bulk order and received Lego's reply via email on 12 September 2015: "We regret to inform you that it is against our corporate policy to indicate our approval of any unaffiliated activities outside the LEGO licensing program. However, we realize that artists may have an interest in using LEGO elements, or casts hereof, as an integrated part of their piece of art. In this connection, the LEGO Group would like to draw your attention to the following: The LEGO trademark cannot be used commercially in any way to promote, or name, the art work. The title of the artwork cannot incorporate the LEGO trademark. We cannot accept that the motive(s) are taken directly from our sales material/copyrighted photo material. The motive(s) cannot contain any political, religious, racist, obscene or defaming statements. It must be clear to the public that the LEGO Group has not sponsored or endorsed the art work/project. Therefore I am very sorry to let you know that we are not in a position to support the exhibition Andy Warhol | Ai Weiwei by supplying the bulk order." Ai Weiwei Studio was informed by NGV about Lego's rejection of the bulk order. As a commercial entity, Lego produces and sells toys, movies and amusement parks attracting children across the globe. As a powerful corporation, Lego is an influential cultural and political actor in the globalized economy with questionable values. Lego's refusal to sell its product to the artist is an act of censorship and discrimination.</a></p>

<p>In a narrow sense, fair enough. Lego is a company and can do basically whatever it wants, including not fulfilling bulk orders to Ai Weiwei. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIOH8Trfas4">That, as noted corporate ethics scholar Britney Spears tells us, is their prerogative</a>.</p>
<div class="pullquoteLeft">
<p>poor choices in things to care about.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>Exercising that prerogative, however, has consequences. Lego&rsquo;s commitment to creativity comes with an implicit asterisk. In a sense, it always has, but periodic reminders are helpful in this regard. Lego is a tool for creativity, but some creative expressions are preferred with a certain distance from corporate headquarters. <a href="http://kotaku.com/5918296/when-lego-becomes-political-art">So Mike Doyle&rsquo;s Lego tableau about the costs of the Iraq War can be made out of the little plastic bricks</a>, but the suits would sure-as-hell rather have nothing to do with this.</p>
<p>Previously in prerogative: <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jun/06/lego-asks-government-remove-scottish-independence-images">Lego asked the UK government to retract ads opposing Scottish independence that featured its bricks</a>. The company feared the ads violated their political neutrality.</p>

<p>Recently in prerogative: <a href="http://boingboing.net/2015/09/29/apple-yanks-drone-strike-track.html">Apple pulled Metadata+, an app that tracked American drone strikes, from its App Store</a>. We&rsquo;ve been here before. During this spring&rsquo;s justified uproar over the continued presence of the confederate flag in front of South Carolina&rsquo;s statehouse, <a href="/articles/videogames-understand-symbols-except-comes-confederate-flag/?utm_content=buffere7c23&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer">the company removed a number of games featuring the treasonous symbol from its store</a>, even though many of them actually (#actually) used the flag in a historical sense. We ultimately live at the App Store&rsquo;s mercy.</p>
<p>Where does that leave us? Well, right where we started. Corporations are not our friends. They make things we like, but their support for our preferred use cases is not a given. The tragedy here is not that corporations have their own interests so much as their poor choices in things to care about. Tech companies could care about so many things, but harassment so rarely makes the list. Lego could be concerned about so many things, but here they are fretting about Ai Weiwei.</p>
<p>Oh well, it&rsquo;s not like they were ever our friends anyhow.</p>

<p>The trailer presents a classic band of characters from various horror subgenres. There's the&nbsp;<span>criminal profiler, Mr. Smith, who just wants to make the world a better place for all the kids out there. Then, there's the kids, who are little more than helpless, kidnapped props for the protagonist to assert his skills and "good guy-ness" over. Finally, there are the monsters: namely a pig man (named Lewis) with a hankering for butchering ala <em>Texas Chainsaw Massacre, </em>a mad doctor (or&nbsp;pediatrician, I&nbsp;suppose), &nbsp;and an oversized baby woman in a tutu. The gangs all there!</span></p>

<p>In our <a href="/articles/fresh-hell-creator-alone-dark/">previous coverage of <em>2Dark</em></a>,&nbsp;Malachi Lakey describes how the "game&rsquo;s characters and objects are modeled in three dimensions, but&nbsp;rendered in two, giving it a distinct sort of plasticine or Playmobil aesthetic." Similarly the childish aesthetic of <em>2Dark</em>, coupled with the unadulterated horror of the situation, strikes an interesting juxtaposition. Though you are cast as the hero, saving all the children, <em>2Dark</em>&nbsp;doesn't appear to overpower you either. There doesn't appear to be guns. And your main course of action is sneaking past all the horror in the mansion, scooping up kids and escorting them to safety while a bunch of murderers traipse about.</p>
<p>Doesn't sound like my ideal father-son or father-daughter outing, but I'm sure it'll bring them closer together. Oh Halloween. Aren't the holidays great?!</p>

Alright, it isn't there&nbsp;<em>right now</em>. But if you go ahead and download Simon Milfred's game <a href="http://www.gm48.net/?page=game&amp;id=72"><em>Omni</em></a> there will be. It brings a delightful twist to the windows that we use to peer into software and the internet on our PCs.</p>
<p>The idea is to guide a monk named Omni across the 2D environments inside your computer to rid it of a virus (no, not a real virus). But the only way you can see Omni is through a small window on your desktop that he's keeping open by magic. As you don't have a full screen to work with, in order to see where you're moving Omni you'll need to grab the window with &nbsp;your cursor and physically move it around to reveal more of this cloaked world.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="pullquoteLeft">
<p>recaptures the magic that the invention of 'windows' had&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>Having this limited view to move around as well as Omni himself can make even the simplest of jumps a challenge. You can make the window bigger by pressing the 'Maximize' button (just as you would on a real window) but as it's fueled by Omni's magic so it will steadily run out and shrink. You can see how much mana that Omni has left by how much of the word "MANABAR" written in blue in the top left of the window remains.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="/media/uploads/mana.gif" width="880" height="535" title="Omni" /></p>
<p>There are other little tricks that re-purpose the functions of the windows we're so used to staring into. Press the 'Minimize' button and Omni will turn into a flying ball for five seconds. This is used to get to out-of-reach areas. Pressing the 'Close' button doesn't close the game as you'd think but I'll leave what it actually does as something for you to discover (you'll want a full mana bar when you do).&nbsp;</p>
<p>What's great about<em> Omni</em> is that it recaptures the magic that the invention of 'windows' had back in the 1980s. People went from the black screens of DOS to staring at the first graphical interface design for PCs that made sense and felt intuitive. It's trifle to point it out now, but calling them windows alluded to the idea that these 2D squares allowed us to peer into a separate virtual world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, Milfred made <em>Omni</em> for the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gm48.net/?page=games&amp;gm48=16">16th gm(48)</a>, which is a 48-hour game jam held quarterly in which every participant uses the game development tool GameMaker.

However, with <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2013/02/18/one-in-five-americans-work-from-home-numbers-seen-rising-over-60/">1 in 5 Americans now working from home</a> thanks to the rise of internet, that image has become a little more dated in recent years. Instead of a water cooler, these online workers often employ chat programs like&nbsp;<a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>, which allow them a sort of virtual office-space to gather around. With it, they&rsquo;re easily able to discuss assignments, share reports with each other, and post way too many gifs of cats. And as great as it is to be able to get in a full day&rsquo;s work without ever needing to leave your couch, working online means that occasionally, progress is halted by a nasty little error&mdash;or <em>Glitch</em>.</p>
<div class="pullquoteLeft">
<p dir="ltr">a nasty little error&mdash;or&nbsp;<em>Glitch&nbsp;</em></p>
</div>
<p>Personally, Slack&rsquo;s always been extremely stable for me. Which is what makes the attention to detail they&rsquo;ve put into their error page so charming. If, on the off chance you stumble across a 404 error in Slack, you&rsquo;ll be greeted by the following page.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="/media/uploads/slackimg_big.png" width="880" height="303" /></p>
<p>At first glance, it seems to simply be a pleasing, grassy field to offset the frustration of encountering a hiccup. However, it also serves as a winking throwback to Flickr and Slack co-founder Stewart Butterfield&rsquo;s short-lived MMO, <a href="https://www.glitchthegame.com/"><em>Glitch</em></a>, as it recreates a level from the game. In <em>Glitch</em>, players focused less on combat and more on collaborative exploration, collection, and building tasks. It&rsquo;s remembered by users for its imaginative, friendly atmosphere, and though it was unfortunately shut down in 2012, a fan-made remake of the game entitled <a href="http://elevengiants.com/"><em>Eleven</em></a> is currently using Glitch&rsquo;s creative commons art assets and source code to allow fans to step back into its world.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the project doesn&rsquo;t yet have a full release date, but for now, Slack users can experience a little bit of that <em>Glitch</em> magic. Going above and beyond a simple image, the Slack error page actually allows users to scroll around the level and click on a variety of objects to play a short animation. Maybe it&rsquo;s not a substitution for the full game, but clicking on chickens to make them hop around certainly does make me feel better about encountering an error.</p>

<p>And so you have. <i>An Interview </i>is Manos Agianniotakis&rsquo; interactive adaptation of Bryony Kimmings and Tim Grayburn&rsquo;s play &ldquo;Fake It &lsquo;Til You Make It.&rdquo; The pair&rsquo;s performances grapple with the issue of clinical depression, particularly as it affects men. <a href="http://www.bryonyandtim.com/#who-section">Here&rsquo;s how they describe the show</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Expect home made music, stupid dancing, onstage arguments, real life stories, tears and&nbsp;truths in this wickedly heartwarming and funny celebration of the wonders and pitfalls of the human brain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consequently, there are not a million choices for you to make in <i>An Interview</i>. It is an interactive experience that is in large part concerned with feelings of hopelessness. There are things to click, but there is no magic button. <i>An Interview </i>and its source material do not take this lightly. They are not dour for dourness&rsquo; sake, but the conversion to interactive fiction has not come with all sorts of game-like features.</p>
<p><i>An Interview </i>reckons with the gap between personal experiences and general trends. Kimmings and Grayburn note &ldquo;mental health related suicide is the number one killer of men under 35&nbsp;in the UK.&rdquo; Their work&mdash;and, by extension, Agianniotakis&rsquo;&mdash;is meant to respond to this phenomenon. The risk here is that the general phenomenon gets conflated with personal experiences. To be depressed is to have a lot in common with others while also often feeling wholly detached from your peers. <i>An Interview </i>addresses this challenge in two ways. First, the interactive narrative allows you to really zoom in the individual experience. You are there, amidst the particulars. You are not inside an infographic. If, however, you find some aspect of yourself in this specific experience, that can help humanize mental health data. &ldquo;Fake It &lsquo;Til You Make It&rdquo; moves from the general to the specific; <i>An Interview </i>is moving in the other direction. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Observing one child who, following his mother's departure, would always joyfully fling his toys far away only to reel them back in and do it all over again, Freud deduced that this "game" was in fact a reenactment of the child's trauma. And by replacing the absence of his mother with that of an object only to recover it immediately allowed the boy to conquer his anguish,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bartleby.com/276/2.html">Freud theorized</a>. Perhaps this was why&nbsp;this peculiar child never raised a fuss when his mother left. "<span>He made it right with himself, so to speak, by&nbsp;dramatizing&nbsp;the same disappearance and return&nbsp;with the objects he had at hand."</span></p>

<p>Like much of Freud's analysis, there's not much to back up all the definitive conclusions he extrapolates from this one anecdote, but it does capture something true about human nature. Often, games and play are a child's only recourse for understanding the strange world around them. Whether or not little Timmy was mimicking/conquering his mom's departure through the game he invented for himself, it's clear it served as some sort of coping mechanism.</p>
<p>In iOS narrative puzzle game <em>Stay, Mum</em>, a young boy named John must learn how to cope with his single mother's busy schedule. As she works tirelessly to support them, John is left alone often (to his mother dismay). But, by unleashing his imagination, John discovers he can cure his loneliness with games. Playing with seven different building blocks, he creates all sorts of surreal shapes and imaginary friends to fill his mother's absence. Adorably, every building block John plays with is given to him by his mother, showing how even when she can't be physically with him, she's still giving her son the tools to excel without her.</p>
<div class="pullquoteLeft">
<p>she's still giving her son the tools to excel without her&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>Creators Lucid Labs hint that there's a lot more to discover about John's relationship with his mother, and why she's so busy all the time. The soundtrack is both tranquil yet somber, capturing this mother-son duo's longing to just spend more time together. I'm still hoping for a happy ending for little Johnny, though. Because even though the separation may be painful, learning to be okay with absence is an important part of human development. And no matter how lonely he gets, Johnny knows games and play will always be there to keep him company.</p>

<p>parallels the survival mentality seen in the tech industries&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>First off, the man is one of the few directors in videogames who despises the medium's focus on violence and murder. When coming up with his first game as director, <em>Drakengard</em>, back in the early 2000s, he looked at the prevalence of games at the time that glorified killing. He thought you'd have to be "insane" to think that killing should ever be pleasurable.&nbsp;That's why, with&nbsp;<em>Drakengard</em>, he justifies the mass murder committed by the protagonist and his army by depicting them as a "twisted organization where everyone's wrong and unjust." Indeed, <em>Drakengard</em> features a supressed pedophile, a cannibal who eats children, incestual love between two of the main characters, as well as suicide and the discussion of child abuse.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>NieR</em>, released in 2010, is a spin-off from the <em>Drakengard</em> series that Yoko has said was influenced by 9/11 and the War on Terror. After these turn-of-the-century events, the vibe that Yoko was&nbsp;<span>getting from society was "you don't have to be insane to kill someone. You just have to think you're right."&nbsp;<em>NieR</em> was a reflection of this thinking. With it, he explored how</span>&nbsp;two opposing perspectives out to kill each other might justify their actions, not necessarily giving preference to either of them.</p>
<p><img src="/media/uploads/nier-boss-2.png" title="NieR" height="495" width="880" /></p>
<p>As such, in<em> NieR</em>&nbsp;you follow a man (called Nier) as he slays beasts known as Shades in order to find a cure for his daughter who has a terminal disease. His reason for killing is to protect his daughter. But by the end of the game you discover that these Shades are actually the spirits of humans who previously separated them from their bodies in order to avoid extinction by the same disease. The idea was to unite the spirits with the clones they had created of their bodies (which were resistant to the disease) once the illness had died out.</p>
<p>Got all that? Okay, good. Now, on a second playthrough of <em>NieR</em>, you gain the ability to hear what the Shades you fight throughout the game are saying. There are also new cutscenes that depict the Shades as people trying to defend their loved ones from Nier's onslaught. Turns out their reason for killing isn't so different to Nier's then, huh? These kinds of revelations is what Yoko's games are all about. It's his way of getting us to engage with discourse around morality, war, and violence in the real world through his work (it's probably not too surprising that he never intended to get involved with videogames in the first place). People often say his games are dark, but Yoko only sees himself as reflecting the world, and seems to suggest that it's the light treatment and expectation of violence in videogames that is truly dark.</p>
<div class="pullquoteLeft">
<p>"how come I'm not human?"&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>That's the recap over for now. Try to let all that sink in. Right then, the question that arises with <em>NieR: Automata</em>&nbsp;is what Yoko sees in the world now and how he has let this mold the game's story. What's the discourse he's going to have us thinking about this time? The significance of the stage play that <em>Automata</em> has connections to is that it gives us insight into the answer (huge thanks to <a href="http://nier2.com/blog/2015/07/09/yorha-summary/">Nier2.com's detailed summary of the play</a>). Let's get into it then: "YoRHa," the stage play, is set in the year&nbsp;11,939AD, which is&nbsp;millennia after <em>NieR</em> took place. But, as with <em>NieR</em>, it's rooted in events that are the consequence of humans nearly going extinct and trying to preserve themselves. This time, the problem is with "Living Machines" that invaded Earth and slaughtered humanity, forcing the survivors to take refuge on the Moon (stick with it).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In hopes of one day resuming life on Earth, the humans constantly send down androids known as YoRHa in order to battle the Living Machines, but after centuries of doing this have so far been unsuccessful. An interesting note is that the Living Machines are able to constantly evolve while humans struggle to keep up continuously developing new technology. It parallels the survival mentality seen in the tech industries in which rapid advances are highly desired and products are made obsolete ever faster. We see this all the time in videogames especially in the pursuit of achieving "realism" through improved computer graphics.</p>
<p><img src="/media/uploads/act2-koenji-high-safe.jpg" title="YoRHa" height="660" width="880" /></p>
<p>Other themes in the play are more typical of cyberpunk fiction. The play follows the latest group of YoRHa units sent down from the Moon to destroy the machines. On the surface, they end up colliding with older YoRHa units known as The Resistance, who say that these newer models look remarkably human. What all YoRHa units have in common is being programmed with false memories. They're also capable of experience fear of death and sorrow when their friends die. The older units have developed these emotions over time and have even given themselves human names, referring to their group as a "family." Inside, there are parts of them that feel human, but what they lack is the near-human look of the newer units. What ensues is plenty of discussion around what constitutes being human. Does looking human matter? Is having human emotions the ultimate decider on what is human? Is knowing love and fearing death enough to be human?&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>"I dream, feel emotion&hellip; how come I'm not human?" starts one such debate. "Because you're not alive." "Our bodies are made out of mechanical parts." "But, if we break, we will die. I&rsquo;m so afraid of dying!"</span></p>
<p>The direct connection to the "YoHRa" stage play that <em>NieR Automata</em> has is that it seems to take place directly after it. You play as the only survivor of the play, one of the newer YoHRa units called&nbsp;<span>No.2 Ver.B, as she is left alone in the world to fight the Living Machines. Where Yoko will take the story from there is anyone's guess. But there is one potential clue in the script of "YoHRa." It goes like this:&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span><span>Erica: The machines have no emotions, that&rsquo;s why they have no fear.</span><br /><span>No.4: But if the enemy would be as varied as us and could learn, perhaps we might face an enemy with emotions of their own one day.</span><br /><span>No.2: That&rsquo;s for sure&hellip;&hellip; An enemy like that would be far more dangerous and frightening than what we&rsquo;re up against now.</span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><iframe width="880" height="500" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/-m4jkS66zKk" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><span><span>Could it be that No.2 ends up discovering new evolved forms of the Living Machines that have developed emotions? It seems a likely direction for Yoko to take the narrative. Especially as it would then touch on themes similar to those explored in the original <em>NieR </em>while also asking the types of questions that <em>Bladerunner</em>, <em>Ghost in the Shell</em>, and<em> Ex Machina </em>did. Where do you draw the line between human and machine? Are you right to kill a machine if it has human emotions and feelings? How humane are human beings if their most invested technology is made to kill?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Of course, while <em>NieR: Automata</em> will probably pry into these profound questions, the only thing certain about it is that it'll be just as violent as Yoko's previous games despite his claims that he is saddened by it. In fact, he said before that he sees how killing permeates videogames, and how there has been no great change to this, as a "personal failure." Yet, by working inside the very thing he despises, Yoko has been driven to call it into question through his narratives, having us reconsider violence in all its forms, inside and outside of videogames.<br /></span></span></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 29 Oct 2015 09:00:00 -0400";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:89:"http://killscreendaily.com/articles/what-stage-play-nier-automata-based-tells-about-game/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:1:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:60:"Die, die, and die again in this Twitter-based adventure game";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:82:"http://killscreendaily.com/articles/die-die-and-die-again-twitter-based-adventure/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2502:"<p dir="ltr"><span>When I scroll through my Twitter feed, I&rsquo;m never hard-pressed to find selfies, silly jokes, personal anecdotes, opinions on whatever dumb, ignorant thing Donald Trump said recently&mdash;but what I don&rsquo;t expect to find is a Choose Your Own Adventure game, complete with pixel art gifs and a seemingly infinite number of choice-related deaths.</span></p>

<h2>Viscera Cleanup Detail (<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/246900/?mc_cid=bf3a5685b6&amp;mc_eid=16ae0976cc">PC</a>)&nbsp;</h2>
<h3>BY Runestorm</h3>
<p><span>For most people, the idea of cleaning up anything sucks. It's a chore; not meant to be enjoyed, just endured. What's going on with&nbsp;</span><em>Viscera Cleanup Detail</em><span>&nbsp;then? This is a videogame purely about cleaning that</span><span>&nbsp;has enjoyed two years of popularity before it was even finished. People are lapping it up like a mop head does spilled liquid. One user review finds comedy in how the person who wrote it refuses to clean their messy room but has scrubbed an entire spaceship in a videogame. Another user review discovers the reason why. "There's something seriously zen about mopping up the aftermath of all these incidents," they write. It's true. Not having to deal with all the smell and feel of the gore, bullet casings, and severed limbs you deal with on the ravaged spaceship, all that's left is the satisfying process of transforming messy rooms into spotless ones. It's bliss.</span></p>
<p><strong>Perfect for:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Janitors, people with ocd, parents of messy teens &nbsp;<span>&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Playtime:</strong>&nbsp;10+ Hours</p>

He has brought them together through common interest to a creative place of his own making that he says is "dedicated to jazz where nothing and everything makes sense!"&nbsp;</p>

<p>What his "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdyXeBw0wr_r_PHfbdqcCM7aFTy0_Jcg0">Jam of the Week</a>" series entails is videos of (mostly) classic jazz songs rigidly recreated with sketchy and often sped-up electronic instrumentation and crudely animated computer-made people. Dizzy Gillespie's jazz standard "A Night in Tunisia" becomes "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMb3LeVYjRw">A Nightmare in Tunisia</a>" under Fransen's hand. The song's bass line is re-purposed as the voice of a balding man in a loose shirt-and-jacket combo who head bangs, bops, and seems to otherwise despair on a crop of rocks. As to the song's tune, it appears as the uncanny singing voice of a scowling woman in a suit stood on the same bunch of rocks&mdash;she's wholly terrifying.</p>
<p><iframe width="880" height="500" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/rMb3LeVYjRw" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Many of Fransen's videos are similarly off the fucking wall. If anything connects them it is that he seems to personify his electronically reconfigured jazz songs through his virtual bodies. Not only does part of the music become their voice for the duration of the clip but it also seem to arrest control of their bodies and subject them to a tortuous type of dance. Limbs and necks are stretched, eyeballs smear, heads collapse into torsos as they spin hideously. Again and again, these virtual people gyrate and gesture as if they were puppets to a serial killer's sick invention; an invisible machine made to produce music out of pulling their bodies apart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I write this especially with "A Nightmare in Tunisia" in mind, as well as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3rF0kFMlPs">his latest video</a> that gradually distorts and rips through The Beatles's "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" until only a blue screen of death is left. But there are less nightmarish (and just as baffling) examples of Fransen's videos such as "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXdakQWgE44">Princess Jordu</a>" (taking its cues from Clifford Brown and Max Roach's "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GslhRUBgXNI">Jordu</a>") that sees a warrior quarreling with a levitating horse inside a garish Gothic castle.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time we've seen an ongoing project like this. A comparison to <a href="http://www.avclub.com/article/music-student-uses-terrifying-graphics-spread-his--227351">Brian's similar melding of electronic music and virtual bodies</a> is warranted. When speaking to Brian earlier this year, he told me that he feels like he is "<span>ripping out all of the emotion that these digital tools could provide</span>" when creating his music. Fransen seems to also want to find emotion in the strained mechanical notes he works with. He turns jazz into dramatic machinima by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRvEy2YE8cs">depicting romances</a> and domestic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2EirNG6q-Y">arguments between lovers</a>.</p>
<p>Why he does this could be questioned eternally. But perhaps this type of unholy spin on 20th century jazz is a gateway to opening it up to generations of people who have grown up with computers and the internet's rapid and bizarre remix culture. "<span>I guess the community for nightmare jazz is still pretty small,"&nbsp;</span>Fransman <a href="https://twitter.com/SimonFransman/status/657320296718999552">said on Twitter</a>.

Coming off the heels of&nbsp;<em>Indigo Prophecy</em>, a game often touted as ahead of its time, and more recently&nbsp;<em>Beyond: Two Souls&nbsp;</em>and<em>&nbsp;Heavy Rain</em>, games often touted as generally pretty&nbsp;<a href="/articles/beyond-two-souls-wants-be-more-videogame-its-much-less/">useless</a>, Cage released a conceptual trailer for a project he's calling&nbsp;<em>Detroit</em>.</p>
<p>Okay, that's not the full title. The full title to David Cage's next game is cringingly&mdash;no,&nbsp;<em></em><i>sickeningly&mdash;</i><em>Detroit: Become Human.&nbsp;</em>Originating from the 2012 tech demo called&nbsp;<em>Kara</em>, <em>Detroit</em> will continue the story of a female android who accidentally develops sentience somehow. The trailer hints at a sci-fi story involving robot rebellions and, as Cage says, questions about "what it means to be human." There's no set release date for the game, but it claims to be a PS4 exclusive.</p>

<p>The most interesting part of this announcement, though, isn't really the game itself. Because the media coverage for <em>Detroit: Become Human </em>has been&mdash;well&mdash;decidedly "meh" about the whole thing.&nbsp;<em><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/10/27/9622364/detroit-playstation-4-game-announced-david-cage-android">The Verge</a></em>&nbsp;describes David Cage's past titles as striving "to be emotionally poignant yet often [struggling] to hit their lofty goals," conceding that, regardless, "that won't stop director David Cage from trying." <em>The Verge</em>&nbsp;also wagers you can bet "there will definitely be a few moments that try to make you cry" in the newest game.</p>
<p>"Quantic Dream and Cage are known for attempting to tell ambitious stories," says&nbsp;<a href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/10/27/quantic-dream-unveils-detroit-become-human-for-the-ps4/">Venture Beat</a>, "but as we saw with&nbsp;<em>Heavy Rain</em>&nbsp;and<em>&nbsp;Beyond: Two Souls</em>&nbsp;in the PlayStation 3 era, their end product doesn&rsquo;t always meet their ambitions." Which, for <em>Venture Beat,</em> is a positively scathing remark.</p>

<p>"that won't stop director David Cage from trying"&nbsp;</p>

<p>In fact, from what I can tell, the most enthusiastic response to the announcement of<em>&nbsp;Detroit: Become Human </em>comes from Cage himself:</p>
<p>"Many people were deeply moved by [the original Kara] and felt empathy for this character who just wanted to live," he explains on the&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.us.playstation.com/2015/10/27/quantic-dreams-latest-game-detroit-revealed-exclusive-to-ps4/">PlayStation Blog</a>. "<span>But everyone had the same question: what happens to Kara when she leaves the factory?&nbsp;<span>I kept asking myself the same question since we released this short. I knew I had to find out!"</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LL2gW7hmXu4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></span></span></p>
<p>But, oddly enough, Cage isn't totally wrong. There were some genuinely interesting ideas in the original tech demo, <em>Kara</em>, (though those ideas were also not immune to the usual so-on-the-nose-it-hurts David Cage-ness). In the original, a feminist undertone characterizes Kara's "birth." She becomes sentient only to learn that her body is to be bought and sold to the highest bidder. She is like Eve, discovering herself for the first time in a watery reflection in the Garden, only to be interrupted by God and told she is subservient&mdash;the bone of another, a reflection only meaningful insofar as it reflects man's greatness.</p>

<p>In the trailer to&nbsp;<em>Detroit: Become Human</em>, a half-assed allusion to slavery is attempted instead&mdash;I think? (I hope not, but I think so.) With the title's uncomfortable juxtaposition of Detroit&mdash;a city known for its history of race riots and current race-related drug, education, and housing problems&mdash;and the tagline "Become Human," coupled with the heavily implied metaphor to slavery, Quantic Dreams appear to be drawing unavoidable parallels. Or, actually, I don't know what would be worse: if Cage genuinely does not see the racial lines he is drawing with <em>Detroit: Become Human,</em> or if he genuinely thinks drawing those comparisons is a good idea. Regardless, the number of white robots being subjected to robot slavery/racism in <em>Detroit</em> makes me uncomfortable.</p>
<p>In the end, however, all is speculation this early in the game. For now, I'll save my outrage for when the inevitable Kara shower scene becomes a controversy.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 28 Oct 2015 09:00:00 -0400";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:92:"http://killscreendaily.com/articles/detroit-become-human-david-cage-uncomfortable-parallels/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:2:{s:4:"href";s:43:"http://killscreendaily.com/articles/latest/";s:3:"rel";s:4:"self";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";a:7:{s:6:"server";s:5:"nginx";s:4:"date";s:29:"Sat, 31 Oct 2015 23:54:21 GMT";s:12:"content-type";s:19:"application/rss+xml";s:10:"connection";s:10:"keep-alive";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Sat, 31 Oct 2015 23:54:21 GMT";s:7:"expires";s:29:"Sun, 01 Nov 2015 00:54:21 GMT";s:13:"cache-control";s:12:"max-age=3600";}s:5:"build";s:14:"20121030175911";}
