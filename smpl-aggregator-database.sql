In typical Tom Clancy form, strategy is a big part of the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-align=&quot;center&quot; data-size=&quot;large&quot; data-img-src=&quot;https://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1179/11799911/3213599-shadow1.jpg&quot; data-ref-id=&quot;1300-3213599&quot; data-ratio=&quot;0.35333333333333&quot; data-width=&quot;750&quot; data-embed-type=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1179/11799911/3213599-shadow1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;No Caption Provided&quot; src=&quot;https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1179/11799911/3213599-shadow1.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1179/11799911/3213599-shadow1.jpg 750w, https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1179/11799911/3213599-shadow1.jpg 480w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px&quot; data-width=&quot;750&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our hope is that the balance between these two aspects is very tight,&quot; ShadowBreak creative director AJ Morales said. &quot;If you''re a great marksman with an inferior troop loadout, you''re still going to have a strong avenue to victory.

Years later he returns, and as adults they must work together to finish the job. The first movie will be about the children''s story, while a second will chronicle the adults'' narrative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new interview with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2017/03/27/see-a-creepy-cool-pennywise-photo-from-stephen-king-it-movie-adaptation/99590666/?hootPostID=0e6f95479c627fc9cf50813e380d4d73&quot;&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt;, director Andr&eacute;s Muschietti spoke about the terrifying clown Pennywise. &quot;It''s established that Pennywise takes the shape of your worst fear,&quot; he said. &ldquo;He doesn''t have a steady behavior, he doesn''t expose how he thinks, and that''s what makes him really unpredictable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Pennywise''s character is motivated by survival.

It''s stuffed to bursting point with gameplay ideas and presentation flourishes--there''s an overwhelming level of artistry in every part of Persona 5, making it a truly standout entry in the series. It''s a refined, effortlessly stylish RPG that will be talked about for years to come.&quot; -- Lucy James [Full Review]Polygon -- 9/10&quot;It&rsquo;s been almost a decade since the original release of Persona 4, a game that introduced many players--including myself--to this series. With that amount of time, with the amount of energy and passion a lot of Persona 4 fans put toward that game, it would have been easy for Persona 5 to be a letdown. Instead, it successfully pushes this series to new heights of polish, allure and charm. It has a few blemishes, enough to distract a bit from the intriguing and weighty themes that the game wrestles with. But even through the rough patches, Persona 5 doesn&rsquo;t give up a drop of its colorful personality.&quot; -- Phillip Kollar [Full Review]Eurogamer -- Essential&quot;Persona 5 is unconscionably sublime. Every beat, every subtlety, every movement of the camera - it all translates into a kinetic masterpiece, strung together with the best visuals this side of Atlus. Persona 5 won''t change your mind on JRPGs if you lack a taste for the genre, but if you''re in any way a fan, well why the hell are you still reading this? Go forth and damn well purchase.&quot; -- Cassandra Khaw [Full Review]Kotaku -- No Score&quot;This game will take many, many hours of your time. In exchange, you&rsquo;ll get a terrific, pulpy story told with style to spare. Persona 5 took nearly 100 hours of my time, and I gave it gladly.&quot; -- Kirk Hamilton [Full Review]Game Informer -- 9.25/10&quot;If the opening hours of Persona 5 are like starting a massive novel, then the closing hours are like finishing one, complete with the bittersweet finality of turning the last page. But it also carries an immense sense of satisfaction. After 100 hours of playing, all of my big questions were answered. I understood the characters, I knew my way around the world, and I had fun almost every step of the journey.

The Home screen now houses a much smaller icon for the game you''re currently playing and provides options to jump to related areas, such as its Game Hub. Additionally, the background will now feature artwork from the game, provided you don''t have custom background art already set.The Guide screen has also been refined and is now accessed with a single press of the Xbox button, rather than two. The first tab that''s shown allows you to move to the Home screen or access the My Games and Apps section, Xbox Store, recently launched apps, pins, and more. There are also background music controls and an easy way to jump into the GameDVR menu, allowing you to record clips of various lengths (up to five minutes) or start recording a manual clip (lasting up to 10 minutes).The other major feature is integration with the Beam game-livestreaming service, which also comes to Windows 10 through an update on April 11. You can read more about Beam in our new interview with Microsoft. Other additions in today''s update include a customizable on-screen Achievement tracker (which somewhat makes up for the removal of Snap mode), Blu-ray player bitstream passthrough, the co-pilot accessibility feature, and more.

Player progression is currently capped at level 40 and individual heroes at level 20. The two systems will be unified in that your player level is the sum of hero levels gained. All previous XP gained will carry over to the update, so those who played beyond the progression caps will be leveled accordingly. Along with removing the ceiling, XP gaps between each level will also be reduced to make for faster, more frequent progression. This is due in large part to the rewards that will be tied to player progress.Each level gained will yield a loot chest--familiar to those who play Overwatch. The newly implemented loot system for Heroes 2.0 guarantees a basic loot chest, while rare and epic loot chests are rewarded for reaching specific milestones. A chest of a certain rarity is guaranteed to drop at least one item of that rarity, and there''s a chance of dropping items of higher rarity. You can expend Gold to reroll loot chests as well. Each chest will contain four items which can consist of playable heroes, portraits, voice lines, and announcer packs. Heroes 2.0 also introduces new types of items, including banners, emojis, and sprays.Emojis will be part of in-game chat and hero-specific emojis are unlockable. Sprays allow you to tag the battleground, another concept similar to Overwatch. Banners are flags that can be dropped on the battleground. Additionally, you''ll be able to organize and package cosmetics into loadouts, so you can enter a match with a specific combination of skins, mounts, banners, and sprays. Each character can have up to three loadouts.The in-game shop will also be renamed Collection, which will include a crafting mechanic using a new item called Shards. Crafting with Shards is simply another avenue to obtain cosmetic items outside of progressing or real money. While Gold is still used to unlock new heroes, the currency system will include Gems, which will now act as real money. Gems can be obtained with real money or through progression, and players will receive 1000 Gems for hitting level 5.To go along with all the changes in the 2.0 update is a new Assassin hero named Cassia. The following is a breakdown of her abilities:Avoidance (Trait) - Grants her 65 physical armor when moving unmounted, meaning she''ll take 65 percent less damage against basic attacks.Lightning Fury (Ability) - A javelin projectile that splits into two bolts that can hit nearby enemies.Blinding Light (Ability) - An area-of-effect (AoE) ability that blinds enemies in its target area for two seconds. It takes 0.5 seconds to activate. Cassia also deals 15 percent extra damage to blinded enemies.Fend (Ability) - Cassia charges with a flurry attack that damages targets every 0.25 seconds for 1.5 seconds. Multiple targets can be hit within a small range, but Cassia is immobile for the duration of Fend.Ball Lightning (Heroic Ability) - A projectile that can bounce around enemies up to six times, dealing damage with every hit.Valkyrie (Heroic Ability) - Summoning a Valkyrie will pull and damage the first enemy hero hit and stun them for 0.5 seconds. Enemies in the path will be knocked back. This ability takes 0.75 seconds to activate.Open beta for Heroes of the Storm 2.0 starts today, and it will officially launch at the end of April.

The Fate of the Furious hits theaters next month, and a new behind-the-scenes featurette has been released. Check it out below:This video follows the insane second trailer which arrived a few weeks back. Watch that here, plus this international promo, and the first trailer.The Fate of the Furious is directed by F. Gary Gray, who most recently helmed the hugely successful hip-hop biopic Straight Outta Compton. Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, and Jason Statham are all returning from the previous movies and are joined by Charlize Theron, Helen Mirren, and Kurt Russell.The movie is the first in the series to be made without the involvement of Paul Walker, who tragically died before he had finished working on 2015''s Furious 7. In a recent interview with GamesRadar, Diesel spoke about the decision to continue the franchise without Walker.&quot;It wasn''t just a question of whether this franchise could work without Paul,&quot; he said. &quot;It was whether I could even survive doing it without Paul. [But] I''d seen this video of Paul guaranteeing eight, while we were making seven. That hit me.&quot;&quot;You''re talking about a bond and a brotherhood,&quot; he continued. &quot;The pain wasn''t about whether something would work. It was about the loss of someone very important in my life. Was there ever any moment I wasn''t thinking about him? That''s the question. Every day I''d be saying, ''this movie has to be amazing because of Paul.''&quot;Last year, Diesel announced the release dates for the next three parts in the series, with parts 9 and 10 following in 2019 and 2021. He also told Variety that there were plans for spinoffs. &quot;We''ve written out story lines for various characters,&quot; he said. &quot;We''ve been playing with it for a long time.

[But] I''d seen this video of Paul guaranteeing eight, while we were making seven. That hit me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You''re talking about a bond and a brotherhood,&quot; he continued. &quot;The pain wasn''t about whether something would work. It was about the loss of someone very important in my life. Was there ever any moment I wasn''t thinking about him? That''s the question.

Microsoft acquired the company and its livestreaming service of the same name last year for an undisclosed sum.Starting today, you can broadcast your gameplay via the Guide and through the Beam app. The image above shows off what this looks like on Xbox One.On Windows 10, Beam broadcasting will be available for everyone starting on April 11. These features have been available for a while now on both platforms through the Xbox Insider Program for testers.GameSpot recently caught up with Microsoft Partner Group Program Manager Chad Gibson to discuss the update and its Beam features specifically. In our interview, Gibson discussed the unique qualities of Beam--the service &quot;blur[s] the lines between the playing and watching experience,&quot; he says.Gibson also discusses what Microsoft learned during the Xbox Insider testing period and how the final product is adjusted as a result. Additionally, he told us a little about how Microsoft plans to grow and evolve Beam in the time ahead with new features and functionality, while he also stressed that other livestreaming services such as Twitch are not going to go away.You can see our full interview below. GameSpot: The Beam acquisition last year I think sort of went under the radar. Can you talk a bit about why Microsoft wanted to pick up Beam and what it adds to your portfolio?Gibson: It''s an exciting time for the game video space and we see a lot of potential with Beam. Matt Salsamendi and James Boehm--Beam co-founders--started a really unique service. Beam''s sub-second latency and interactive options connect steamers and viewers like never before, and we''re going to continue to evolve Beam and blur the lines between the playing and watching experience. For example, after we launch the Beam viewing app on Xbox One, and Beam broadcasting from the Guide on Xbox One and Game bar on Windows 10 PC, we''re going to really focus on how we can help partners and creators by building features that enables them and their viewers to interact in compelling ways. That''s our guiding force. The interactive nature of the service is pretty cool and sets you apart from your competitors. Can you talk more about this?Yeah, of course. Beam''s low-latency enables streamers and viewers to interact and engage with each other in near real-time, whereas traditional streaming latency on other platforms is about 8-10 seconds. Beam interactivity ranges from sounds boards and screen effects to game integration. At GDC we talked through a few examples that we are working on with a number of first- third-party game developers to bring to market. In one example, the game can identify a particular &quot;chosen&quot; viewer and allow that viewer to decide if they are going to help or challenge the player/streamer they are watching, at a high level. In another example, the game could reward the viewers who helped the player/streamer beat a boss by arming their weapon with various power-ups. The interactivity platform enables games to treat the audience as an active participant of the game session. This translates to innovation potential for both developers and gamers, through game experiences, that we expect to come to market later this year.How will Beam exactly be integrated into Xbox One and Windows 10 from a functional perspective? Do you have any plans to bring it to the Xbox App?[Starting today] you''ll be able to stream your Xbox gameplay on Beam directly from the Guide on your Xbox One, with the ability to manage your Beam broadcasts and interact with fellow gamers on chat overlays that appear on your screen. You''ll also be able to watch, interact, and chat with streamers using the Beam viewing app on Xbox One. We''ve also added Beam functionality right into Windows 10 at a system level, and starting April 11, you''ll be able to start a broadcast almost instantly using the Game bar--no extra software is required. What have you seen from the Preview release in terms of feedback and what changes are you making as a result?We use the Xbox and Windows Insider Programs to gather feedback from gamers. We want them to have an active role in shaping the Beam experience, and we have received some great feedback. In terms of specific changes we''ve made, here are a few that come to mind: We''ve made changes to the way the navigation works in the Xbox One viewing app so it&rsquo;s easier to scroll through long lists, added controller shortcuts to make jumping to chat much faster, and minimized how much configuration is necessary to start a stream with native broadcasting.  Obviously low-latency is a big part of Beam. It wouldn''t be what it is without it. What can you say about what''s going on under the hood, technically, to allow this?Our FTL streaming protocol delivers sub-second video latency for streamers. With FTL the network traffic is closer to how voice communications or multiplayer games are built than traditional media streaming. Technically speaking, using UDP vs. HTTP for delivery. Our FTL SDK takes care of packaging the media into the appropriate networking format to send to the Beam ingest servers. The FTL SDK is consumed by native broadcasting--in the case of Xbox One and the Windows Game bar--and we also make it available for applications such as Open Broadcaster Software &amp; XSplit to enable low latency streaming directly to Beam.Can you talk about how you will continue to grow and evolve Beam with new features and functionality in the future?We have a lot of things going on right now. One of the areas we''re focused on are partnerships for interactivity--for both community and game developers. That''s the area that I''m most excited about. The whole concept where viewers are part of the game experience is very exciting. There are so many ideas for great game integrations. We''re excited to get those to market and continue to foster the great community on Beam. We&rsquo;ll also have exciting new differentiators rolling out in the months ahead. And partners are pretty excited too. The coolest thing about our partner conversations is how creative they are--every conversation starts with an idea that we haven''t even thought about. Most developers already realize how important it is to have their games watched and streamed. We don''t have to educate them on that, so the conversations get right into the meat of interactivity and we explore what can be done to make their games interactive. Beam being a first-party product, it''s going to receive preferential treatment, I would imagine. But is anything going to change for other livestreaming services such as Twitch?Gamers on Xbox One will still be able to broadcast to Twitch--they''ll be no changes there. The game video space is growing rapidly and we believe there is an opportunity for multiple broadcast providers to participate and give gamers more choice over their gaming experiences. We''re really excited about Beam and its differentiators like low latency and interactivity, and we''ll continue to listen to our fans to make Beam a place where broadcasters and viewers want to go to watch game streams, interact, and engage with one another.
